## What is The Spawner Server

It is a special server whose main purpose is to "spawn" game servers. 

## How Spawning Game Servers Works

When Spawner server is started, it registers to Master Server. After the registration `SpawnerLink` object is created and stored within the `SpawnersModule`.

`SpawnerLink` represents what Master server knows about the Spawner servers, and it can be used to create a spawn request through `OrderSpawn` method:

`public SpawnTask OrderSpawn(Dictionary<string, string> properties)`. It:

1. Checks if machine on which server should be spawned is busy
2. Checks if queue is not full
3. Creates a `SpawnTask` and returns it

`SpawnTask`has some helpful methods to check the state of "spawn process":
* `WhenDone(Action<SpawnTask> callback)` - registers a callback, which is invoked when spawn task is completed, aborted, or fails otherwise. Spawn task is completed when Game server registers itself to the Master
* `Abort(string reason)` - aborts active request
* `Start()` - sends the request to spawner server to start the process, if it's not yet started. This method can be used to force-start without waiting in queue.

Scheme below illustrates the spawning process.

## API

### Spawning a Server From Client (As User)

`SpawnersModule.CreateUserGame(Dictionary<string,string> data, GameCreationStartedCallback callback)`

Calling this static method sends a request from user to Master Server. `GameCreationStartedCallback` has to parameters: `GameCreationProcess` and `error`. If request was not successfull, callback will be called with error message and `GameCreationProcess` will be set to `null`

### Spawning a Server From Master Server

Spawning a server from within the master server can be done in these steps:

``` C#
module = master.GetModule<SpawnersModule>()
var task = module.Spawn(properties);
```

Default implementation of `Spawn` method goes through these steps:

1. Analyzes the given properties in the `GetSpawners` method to filter appropriate spawners
2. Picks the least busy spawner (`SpawnerLink`)
3. Calls `spawnerLink.OrderSpawn()`

### Implementing Specific Logic For Picking an appropriate Spawner Server

`Spawn ` method calls `GetSpawners(Dictionary<string, string> properties) method`. This method should analyse properties in the dictionary to filter spawner servers. 

 For example, if you wanted to filter spawners by region, **you could override** the `GetSpawners(properties)` method to check the region property like this:

 ``` C#

public override IEnumerable<SpawnerLink> GetSpawners(Dictionary<string, string> properties)
        {
            var region = properties.ContainsKey("region") ? properties["region"].ToLower() : null;

            // If region filter was not used
            if (region == null)
                return Spawners.Values;

            // Return all spawners in a given region
            return Spawners.Values
                .Where(s => s.Properties.ContainsKey("region"))
                .Where(s => s.Properties["region"].ToLower() == region);
        }

 ```
