### Overview

1. **Client sends reques** to master server to spawn a game server
1. Master server finds an appropriate spawner and passes it the request
1. **Spawner starts a new unity instance** (process)
   1. Process switches to necessary scene (optional)
   1. In that scene, there should be scripts that:
      1. Connect to master server
      1. Notifies master server that a new process was started
      1. Starts a game server
      1. Registers the game server (room)
1. Master server notifies client that a server that he requested was created (**finalized**)

### Registering a Spawner

When client sends a request to spawn a server, master server picks one of the spawners from the list of registered spawners. 

Spawner is essentially an instance of unity, which starts other unity instances. It can be an almost empty unity build, with a script which connects to master server, and registers itself as a spawner.

To register a spawner:

``` C#
var options = new SpawnerOptions()
{
    MaxProcesses = 0, // Unlimited,
    MachineIp = "127.0.0.1", // Public IP address of this machine
    Region = "US", // Region identifier, can be anything
    Properties = new Dictionary<string, string>()
    {
        // If you need spawner to have some extra properties
        {"ExtraProperty", "Whatever" }
    }
};

// Registers a spawner to master server, so that master server knows about it's existance.
// Your spawner will receive requests to spawn unity instances
Msf.Server.Spawners.RegisterSpawner(options, (spawner, error) =>
{
    if (spawner == null)
    {
        Logs.Error(error);
        return;
    }

    // Set the build path (default ""(empty string))
    // When spawner receives a request, it will use this build to start unity instances
    // If you set it to an empty string (""), spawned instance will use same binaries
    // as spawner does
    spawner.DefaultSpawnerSettings.ExecutablePath = "C:/Win/Build.exe";
});
``` 

### Sending a request to spawn server

**This should be done on Client**

‚ö†Ô∏è Before executing this script, make sure you're connected to master server and logged in. If you don't know how to do it - check out other guides - you're probably getting ahead of yourself üòÑ 

Below is an example of a script, which sends a request to spawn a game server. Read the commends to understand how it works.

This script can be attached to a button or any other game object.

‚ÑπÔ∏è  This is a not-commented and unsafe version (without checking for errors). I think this way it's easier to see what's actually happening. **Below it, you'll find an example of a safer usage with comments**

``` C#
using System.Collections;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using Barebones.MasterServer;
using UnityEngine;
using UnityEngine.UI;

public class SpawnRequestExampleUnsafe : MonoBehaviour
{
    public Button SendRequestButton;

    void Awake()
    {
        SendRequestButton = SendRequestButton ?? GetComponent<Button>();

        // When button is clicked, invoke SendRequest method
        SendRequestButton.onClick.AddListener(SendRequest);
    }

    public void SendRequest()
    {
        var spawnOptions = new Dictionary<string, string>
        {
            {MsfDictKeys.MaxPlayers, "5"},
            {MsfDictKeys.RoomName, "Name of your Room"},
            {MsfDictKeys.MapName, "Map Name"},
            {MsfDictKeys.SceneName, "GameScene"}
        };

        Msf.Client.Spawners.RequestSpawn(spawnOptions, "", (controller, error) =>
        {
            StartCoroutine(WaitForServerToBeFinalized(controller));
        });
    }

    private IEnumerator WaitForServerToBeFinalized(SpawnRequestController request)
    {
        while (request.Status != SpawnStatus.Finalized)
            yield return null;

        request.GetCompletionData((data, error) =>
        {
            var roomId = int.Parse(data[MsfDictKeys.RoomId]);

            GetRoomAccess(roomId);
        });
    }

    public void GetRoomAccess(int roomId)
    {
        Msf.Client.Rooms.GetAccess(roomId, (access, error) =>
        {
            // Use the access
        });
    }
}

```

Here's the same script without safety checks (might be easier to see how it works):
