## Feature Requests, Bugs and Improvement Ideas

I want to make your experience of running Barebones Master Server as simple, easy and convenient as possible.

Even if you've downloaded this illegally, feel free to contact me with ideas for improvements or feature requests.

## Editing Source code

It's highly advised that you don't make any changes to source code. In most cases, you should be able to make changes by implementing interfaces, extending classes or subscribing to events. If you edit the source, it's possible that your project will break when you download an update, because your changes will be overwritten.

_With that said, it's still possible that you might stumble upon an issue where there's no work around. In that case, make the changes and contact me, I'll try to provide a better access to what you need in the next update._
