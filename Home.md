## Regarding Feature Requests, Bugs and Improvement Ideas

I want to make your experience of running Barebones Master Server as simple, easy and convenient as possible.

Even if you've downloaded this illegally, feel free to contact me with ideas for improvements or feature requests.

We're in this together :)

## Regarding Editing Source code

It's highly advised that you don't make any changes to source code. In most cases, you should be able to make changes by implementing interfaces, extending classes or subscribing to events. 

:warning: _If you find yourself in a situation where there's no way around, feel free to contact me, and I'll try to provide access to what you need in the next update._
