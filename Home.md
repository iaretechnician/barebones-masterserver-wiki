Under the hood, framework is quite simple, but variety of different concepts might be a bit difficult to grasp at first - these guides are here to help you find your away through it.

_**If you found a section that's lacking**, or if you want something covered in the documentation - post a feature request here, in GitHub (Issues tab)_, or send me a personal message. I know what it feels to own a product with great documentation, so I'll be more than happy to assist. üåû

## Editing Source code

It's highly advised that you don't make any changes to source code. In most cases, you should be able to make changes by implementing interfaces, extending classes or subscribing to events. If you edit the source, it's possible that your project will break when you download an update, because your changes will be overwritten.

_With that said, it's still possible that you might stumble upon an issue where there's no work around. In that case, make the changes and contact me, I'll try to provide a better access to what you need in the next update._
