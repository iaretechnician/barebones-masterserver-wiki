### Start From Basics, Don't Rewrite Demos

I really recommend to start working with the framework "from scratch", instead of trying to hack the demo's to fit your game.

The thing is - in each demo, there's a lot going on. There are things that you need, there are things that you don't need, and other things that you want to change. It's very easy to get lost in all of this.

Instead, a better approach would be to start small, for example:
1. Get a basic Master Server working
1. Get a basic client to connect to master server
1. Do a basic authentication
1. Learn how to register a game server to master server
1. Learn to use the spawner
1. And so on...

Smaller steps will help you to make sure that you **understand how everything works**, and when something doesn't work - you'll know exactly what's wrong.

> I've noticed that many users like to start by rewriting the demo to suit their games. And when something doesn't work - they spend a large amount of time trying to understand what's wrong. ❗️ It's actually **faster** to do everything from scratch
