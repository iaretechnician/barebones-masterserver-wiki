## What Is Master Server

In general, **Master Server** is a type of server to which everything connects (a central server). 

Master Server Framework is a framework designed to kick-start the development of such server.

**Master Server** itself is actually a pretty simple script, which:
* Listens to a specific port for clients, so that clients can connect to master server
* Looks for modules in the scene and initializes them.

## Adding The Master Server To Scene

You can add the Master Server to **any scene** by creating a game object and adding `Master` component to it. Here's an example of the most simple Master Server you can have:

To add modules, you simply add new game objects and attach module components (scripts) to them. It doesn't matter where you place your modules in the scene, for example:

⚠️ Some of the modules have dependencies (other modules they depend on). If you add such a module without adding it's dependency, its `.Initialize(IMaster master)` method **will not be called**.

## Starting The Master Server

There are three ways in which you can start the Master Server:

1. In the editor: `Master` component has a flag in the inspector called "**Auto Start In Editor**". When it's set, Master Server will be started automatically when you hit the Play button in the editor.
2. Through command line arguments: 🔗 [Command Line Arguments](https://github.com/alvyxaz/barebones-masterserver/wiki/Command-Line-Arguments#list-of-supported-arguments)
3. By manually calling `Master.Start()` in your scripts.

You'll probably want to start the server in editor when you're developing, through command line in production, and manually - if you have something special planned (a UI, for example).

ℹ️ `Master` component also looks for a special command line argument


## Modules Explained

As described above, master server merely initializes other modules. You can find modules in the `Barebones/MasterModules/` folder.

A few words on modules:
* Modules are intended to **add functionality to Master Server**.
* Modules are unity components, and can be **extended/modified by overriding their virtual methods**.

Let's say you've decided to add a shop to your game. Shop processes (buy/sell, etc.) should be handled in the central server (master server).

So, to add new functionality (shop) to the master server, we can create a **ShopModule**, which will handle buy / sell requests from clients.

When working on a game, your Master Server will be a combination of custom modules and modules from the framework
