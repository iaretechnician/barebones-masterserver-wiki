## About This Tutorial

From all the e-mails and messages I've received, it's apparent that many people find it hard to grasp how everything works together, especially when you are able to start the master server, connect to it as a client, and start a game in the **same scene and same build**. 

This setup is great for development, but I agree that it can **blow your mind** a bit ðŸ˜„.

So this tutorial will try to separate some of the concepts, and will guide you through the process setting everything up yourself, from scratch, without using built-in components.

During this tutorial, we will focus on:

* Creating a separate project/build for Client and Master Server
* Adding modules to Master Server
* Connecting client to the Master Server
* Integrating a game to the framework
* Creating a custom module
